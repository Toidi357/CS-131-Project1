Solution for CS 131 F25 Project 3

Status: missing test_uninitialized_var test. Im quite sure it's not an actual problem with catching dereferenced nil's, but it's probably other parts of the code that are causing my interpreter to crash. It happens to not fail any other tests since other tests don't test the other functionality.
